#orb_vio

**Current version:** 1.0.0 

orb_vio is a real-time monocular visual-inertial SLAM system developed by YuanXingShiKong, which compute the sensor's trajectory and environment sparse 3D map. It is able to detect loops and relocalize the sensor in real time.

We have tested the library in **Ubuntu 12.04** and **14.04**, but it should be easy to compile in other platforms. A powerful computer (e.g. i7) will ensure real-time performance and provide more stable and accurate results.

## C++11 or C++0x Compiler
We use the new thread and chrono functionalities of C++11.

## Pangolin
We use [Pangolin](https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin) for visualization and user interface. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin.

## OpenCV
We use [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) to manipulate images and features. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: http://opencv.org. **Required at leat 2.4.3. Tested with OpenCV 2.4.11**.

## Eigen3
Required by g2o (see below). Download and install instructions can be found at: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org. **Required at least 3.1.0**.

## BLAS and LAPACK
[BLAS](http://www.netlib.org/blas) and [LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack) libraries are requiered by g2o (see below). On ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install libblas-dev
sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev
```

## DBoW2 and g2o (Included in Thirdparty folder)
We use modified versions of the [DBoW2](https://github.com/dorian3d/DBoW2) library to perform place recognition and [g2o](https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o) library to perform non-linear optimizations. Both modified libraries (which are BSD) are included in the *Thirdparty* folder.

## GtSam 4.0
We use GTSAM 4.0 as a optimizer to solve the LocalBundleAndjustment Problem, please go to [http://borg.cc.gatech.edu/download] to download the latest library version
